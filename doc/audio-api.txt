Audio hierarchy
===============

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.Audio
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX

This is a generic audio interface that abstracts the different audio profiles.

Methods		void Connect()

			Connect all supported audio profiles on the device.

		void Disconnect()

			Disconnect all audio profiles on the device

		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all properties for the interface. See the
			properties section for available properties.

Signals		void PropertyChanged(string name, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	string State

			Possible values: "disconnected", "connecting",
			"connected"

			"disconnected" -> "connecting"
				Either an incoming or outgoing connection
				attempt ongoing.

			"connecting" -> "disconnected"
				Connection attempt failed

			"connecting" -> "connected"
				Successfully connected

			"connected" -> "disconnected"
				Disconnected from the remote device

Headset hierarchy
=================

Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.Headset
Object path	[variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX

Methods		void Connect()

			Connect to the HSP/HFP service on the remote device.

		void Disconnect()

			Disconnect from the HSP/HFP service on the remote
			device.

		boolean IsConnected() {deprecated}

			Returns TRUE if there is a active connection to the
			HSP/HFP connection on the remote device.

		void IndicateCall()

			Indicate an incoming call on the headset
			connected to the stream. Will continue to
			ring the headset about every 3 seconds.

		void CancelCall()

			Cancel the incoming call indication.

		void Play()

			Open the audio connection to the headset.

		void Stop()

			Close the audio connection.

		boolean IsPlaying() {deprecated}

			Returns true if an audio connection to the headset
			is active.

		uint16 GetSpeakerGain() {deprecated}

			Returns the current speaker gain if available,
			otherwise returns the error NotAvailable.

		uint16 GetMicrophoneGain() {deprecated}

			Returns the current microphone gain if available,
			otherwise returns the error NotAvailable.

		void SetSpeakerGain(uint16 gain) {deprecated}

			Changes the current speaker gain if possible.

		void SetMicrophoneGain(uint16 gain) {deprecated}

			Changes the current speaker gain if possible.

		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all properties for the interface. See the
			properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments

		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed a read-write are changeable.
			On success this will emit a PropertyChanged signal.
